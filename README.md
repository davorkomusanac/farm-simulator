Simulate milking process at a dairy farm

This is a project that was done through a MOOC course (Object-Oriented programming with Java, part II) by University of Helsinki. 
This specific project (exercise 31.) was a project for week 10 ( https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/part2/week-10/ ).

As it is a part of the course, it is validated through TMC which runs the tests online, so my project had to be modified in some parts to accommodate the tests so that I would get points for it.

This is how the project should work:

Dairy farms have got milking animals; they do not handle milk themselves, but milk trucks transport it to dairy factories which process it into a variety of milk products.
This is a simulator which represents the milk course of life.
